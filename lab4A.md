# Seneca Academic Integrity Policy

## Purpose
To maintain a high standard of **academic integrity** across the Seneca community and provide the foundation for research, teaching, learning, and working practices. 

## Scope
This policy applies to **current students** and **employees**.

## Key Definitions

### Academic Integrity
> Within an academic environment, “a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to six fundamental values: **honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility and courage**.”  
> From these values flow principles of behaviour that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action to ensure the credentials granted to students accurately reflect their demonstrated knowledge and abilities. 

### Cheating
Obtaining or attempting to get, or aiding another person to obtain, credit for work or improvement in performance evaluation by dishonest or deceptive means.  
Examples include, but are not limited to: **self-plagiarism, impersonation, falsification, taking individual credit for group work, unauthorized collaborations and aids, and undeclared AI use**.  

### Seneca Business Day
Monday to Friday, excluding statutory holidays or any other day Seneca has publicly acknowledged that it is closed.

### Contract Cheating
When a student submits academic work created by a third party as if it were their own for academic credit. It may involve a fee paid or an exchange of other items.

### Falsification/Fabrication
Misrepresenting another student’s academic work, withholding or forging documentation (e.g., medical, academic, placement records), or creating/altering false information to gain an academic advantage.

### Impersonation
Taking a test, exam, or other assessment on behalf of another individual in a physical or virtual setting, with their knowledge and consent. 

### Official Transcript
A detailed record of a student’s academic history that carries an authorized signature and can be requested for a fee.

### Plagiarism
Using another individual’s, group’s, or organization’s work (e.g., words, images, ideas, logic, phrases, computations) as is or modified, and presenting it as one’s own without proper citation.  
This may also include **self-plagiarism**.

### Self-Plagiarism
The unauthorized re-use of one’s work from previous assignments.

### Student Record
A documented history of a student’s educational progress found in the Student Centre.  
May include electronic notations/service indicators (e.g., outstanding fees). These are not visible on an official transcript. 

### Unauthorized Aid
Using non-approved supports to complete coursework or assessments, including but not limited to: **peer collaborations, AI technology, the internet, smartphones**.

### Undeclared AI Use
Using artificial intelligence to generate part or all of an assessment without a disclosure statement outlining how and to what extent AI was used.

### Seneca’s Academic Integrity Program
A holistic, integrated model grounded in teaching and learning that requires the engagement and participation of students and various academic and service areas.

### Academic Integrity Violation
An attempt to gain an unfair advantage in any formal assessment, such as coursework and exams.

### Hybrid Delivery
When some parts of a program or course are delivered online, and others are in person.

### Flexible Course Delivery
When professors teach a class in person and simultaneously broadcast it online. Students may choose to attend on campus or remotely.
